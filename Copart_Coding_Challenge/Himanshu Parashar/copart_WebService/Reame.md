#Copart Coding Excercise

- ###Copart_WebService - I made the REST webservice using Jersey libraries in Java on eclipse IDE. I have implemented the CRUD operations on a vehicle where we can add, delete, update and access the vehicles through get operations. We can access the vehicle through its model,make,year,class or vehicle ID. I have added some automated test cases also. I ran it on my local Tomcat server and some sample path are given in "URIs and Test Cases" text file.

- ###pdfToText - To extract text from pdf file and get the vehicle id and license plate information.

- ###copartStringToInetger - Converts string to integer without using inbuilt java libraries.

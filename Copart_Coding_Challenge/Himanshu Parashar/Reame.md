#Copart Coding Excercise

- ###Copart_WebService - I made the REST webservice using Jersey libraries in Java on eclipse IDE. I have implemented the CRUD operations on a vehicle where we can add, delete, update and access the vehicles through get operations. We can access the vehicle through its model,make,year,class or vehicle ID. I have added some automated test cases also. I ran it on my local Tomcat server and some sample path are given in "URIs and Test Cases" text file.
- How to Run - I have run it on Apache tomcat 6.0. I have included it in repository as "copart_WebService.war". It can be deoployed and run on Apache. Or you can Run it through Eclipse by downloading it along with all libraries I have added and Right right click and run on server then the sample URI I have given in "URIs and Test Cases" can be used on any browser to use web service.

- ###pdfToText - To extract text from pdf file and get the vehicle id and license plate information.

- ###copartStringToInetger - Converts string to integer without using inbuilt java libraries.

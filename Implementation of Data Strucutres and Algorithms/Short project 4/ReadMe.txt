==============================
The following files are submitted as part of SP4 short project:
-BST.java
-Tree.java

It contains the following methods
a)	Comparable[] levelOrderArray()
	Produces an array with the values of the nodes of the BST in level order.

b)	BST(T[] arr)
	Builds a balanced search tree from elements of a sorted array.

c)	void removeTwo(Entry<T> x)
	The above method has been rewritten to replace the removed node by the maximum element in the left subtree. 

d) Tree.java has been updated to decrease running time of the algorithm.

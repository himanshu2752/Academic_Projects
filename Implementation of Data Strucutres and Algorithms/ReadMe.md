# Implementation of Advance Data Structure and algorithms

### Project 0
 Implemented sorting algorithms - Merge Sort and Priority Queue using java generics. And compared running times for
####input > 1million
- calculated average time of both sorts for inputs - 1million, 5million, 8million, 10million and 100million.
- increased input till "out of memory exception".
- compared and analyzed both sorts

####Though MergeSort and PriorityQueue both have O(NlogN) running time but from this analysis we were able to see that when input increases above 1million MergeSort running time is slightly better than PriorityQueue. Running time remains almost same for both sorts till input =1million.

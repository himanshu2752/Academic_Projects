###The project is about implementing sockets to demonstrate a Client/Server model which communicate with each other using messages. The communication is established using sockets. A socket is one end-point of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network or simply saying Socket classes are used to represent the connection between a client program and a server program. We have used Java language for this project and the java.net package in the Java development environment provides a class ”Socket” that represents one end of a two-way connection between our Java program and another program on the network.

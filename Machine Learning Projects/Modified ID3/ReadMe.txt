	-> javac Node.java
	-> javac rows.java
	-> algorithm_ID3.java

4. Run Command = Java Java_file_containing_driver_function "Nameoftrainingset" "NameofTestingSet"
exmple:-
	Java algorithm_ID3 "train2-win.dat" "test2-win.dat"

5. Please Note - Code from previous assignment is commented. Since we are comparing ID3 with Randomly selecting attribute for splitting.

6. Each time when we run the Program Accuracy of Test data is changing. Training data accuracy is same. The Function which is selecting the attributes randomly for splitting has different summary each time.
